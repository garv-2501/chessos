<h1 align="center">CHESSOS</h1>
<h2 align="center">THE OPEN CHESS PLATFORM FOR EVERYONE</h2>

ChessOS is an open-source platform being built to make powerful chess tooling free and available to everyone.

This project is public, community-driven, and actively looking for contributors.

## Vision

1. Build the best free chess analysis and prediction platform using Stockfish.
2. Evolve into a chess coach that reviews your past games, tracks your game history, and helps you improve with personalized feedback, mistake detection, and learning resources.
3. Add a full games corpus so players can compare their games against historical lines and real games played by others.

## Why Contribute

- Help make high-quality chess improvement tools accessible to everyone.
- Work on real features across frontend, backend, engines, and data.
- Shape the roadmap of a platform intended for long-term community ownership.

## Contribution Areas Needed
